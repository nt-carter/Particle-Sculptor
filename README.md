Designed around my masters thesis project (granular technology and composition inspired by ancient Epicurean atomism), *Particle Sculptor* features 'atomic-level' interface and DSP elements for manually crafting real-time grain streams on a **grain-by-grain** basis.

## Features
- 20-voice polyphonic, sample-accurate grain engine for sound file granulation (built in mc.gen~)
- Audio input: drag/drop/load sound file and direct recording options
- Polyphonic **per-grain** effects interface – featuring amplitude modulation, delay line, and bandpass filter effects with configurable signal chain order
- Modulation controls with custom parameter assignment – XY slider, 6 LFOs, and random value setting functions.
- Unlimited preset bank system – set presets, save them as a bank, load/recall other banks + Smooth preset interpolation for complex synthesiser wide animations.

## Synthesiser running requirements / download and start quick guide
The synthesiser is currently available as a Max project. **An installation of Max 8.5 or later is required in order to be able to run the synthesiser** (Potential stanalone application release coming – stay tuned).

Quick guide - set up steps:
1. Download the repository
2. Open Max –> File...> Open... > (select Max Project folder). This will open the project window and the main synth patch.
3. To learn how to use the synthesiser, see the demo video below...
