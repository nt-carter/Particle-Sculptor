# Particle Sculptor
*Max/MSP polyphonic granular synthesiser - per-grain processing, per-voice effects controls, and custom modulation controls*

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Designed around my masters thesis project (granular technology and composition inspired by ancient Epicurean atomism), *Particle Sculptor* features 'atomic-level' interface and DSP elements for manually crafting real-time grain streams on a **grain-by-grain** basis.
